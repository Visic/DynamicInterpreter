--Consider adding inverse matches
--Add support for the empty string match ''
--Evaluate the performance of the generated parsers and optimize if needed
--Bug? I don't think the GrammarParser will behave reasonably with input like.. 'test' = 'something else' or -<anything> = <anything else>
	-When I parse and assignment, I probably need to check the type of the token which is being assigned to (and make sure it's not a negative match)

--Working on
--Consider adding range support (e.g. any lowercase char [a-z])
